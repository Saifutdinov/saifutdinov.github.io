- Set up and maintained the database (MySQL, PDO)
- Deployed the product via SFTP and configured LAMP/LNMP server environments

---

### BSSL, Moscow.  2019 - Present (6 years)
#### - legacy-code PHP + MongoDB. 2019 - Present (6 years)
A singleton project with a long history of improvements and transformations, originally handed over by senior developers. I've been continuously maintaining and enhancing this legacy system, which uses PHP 5.6. This project also introduced me to a custom PDF generator written in PHP, leveraging PDF references for file creation.

- Migrated and optimized inherited systems
- Configured MongoDB to handle unique data storage challenges  
- Participated in planning phases and integrated new modules
- Developed numerous Excel exports of varying complexity and PDF reports for diverse clients

---

#### - Golang + React. 2022 - Present (4 years)
Together with the team, I designed and developed a large-scale project, azimuth.team. You can learn more about the project at the link above; here are the key points
- Tech Stack: Golang, React, Postgesql
- API Development: Built and optimized a REST API using the Golang Echo framework
- CI/CD and Deployment: Set up pipelines for both backend (Go) and frontend (React, native JS, Webpack, Gulp), along with a mail server (Exim) integration featuring spam protection  
- Architecture and Modules: Contributed to designing the architecture and building extensible modules
    - Successfully split the project layers according to Clean Architecture principles
- Certificates Management: Configured and automated certificate renewals (Certbot + Let’s Encrypt)
- Custom Go Packages: Wrote several packages for handling maps, slices, requests/responses, panics, errors, and caching (via the sync package), enabling more flexible use of the language
- Alerts System: Implemented an alert system using long polling (React) and channels (Go)

---

### Freelance (PHP + Laravel/Symfony + Vue/React + MongoDB/SQL) 2023 - Present (3 years)
During this period, I’ve tackled a variety of client requests and developed an “Updater” tool that uses .sh scripts to automatically upgrade project versions (particularly useful when code is hosted on a client’s server and updates are optional).
- Developed web applications for clients using Laravel
- Implemented front-end solutions with Vue.js (Vite)
- Planned and deployed projects within tight timelines
- Created data parsers for handling complex data transformations

## Education
### Mospolytech (Moscow Polytechnic University) (2015 - 2019 г.)
- Faculty **"Information Systems and Technologies"**
- Specialization **"Web Development"**

During my time at university, I gained the skills to develop a project from the initial idea stage to the first MVP—along with attracting initial investors. I also completed a course on online project promotion, including SEO optimization for search engines.

Each year, we were divided into teams and given a project assignment to work on throughout the academic year, culminating in a final presentation to our instructors. I was responsible for backend, frontend, and mobile development, as well as preparing the project documentation.

## Summary

I started taking an interest in development back in 2014 while still in school, writing simple applications in PHP and JavaScript. At university, I gained enough knowledge to begin working by my second year, which I did. After graduating, I landed a junior developer role, where I received mentorship from senior engineers—an experience that helped me become a confident developer and contribute significantly to my company. I’m grateful for the supportive environment, great colleagues, and engaging projects, and in return I delivered high-quality development and loyalty.

However, we all grow eventually, and now I’m ready to move forward! After reflecting on my career path, I’ve decided that leading a team is a natural next step for me as a Senior Engineer. I understand how challenging it can be to find the right person to head up a team or a strategic area, and I’m confident that I can excel in this role.

## Others
Together with my colleagues at BSSL, we developed a universal platform to conduct a wide range of surveys. One of these is the [“Big Potential Test”](https://azimuth.team/go/btp)!.

Here are my own results: [link to results](https://azimuth.team/result/3243813746456470411/6286647688042621408/0/0/7c231c655082be7cf9591da61f120752234edf9c52e4f2834cdad310b3dd3b42/0/ru#undefined)
I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome—many of the insights lined up with what my friends and family have observed about me.
